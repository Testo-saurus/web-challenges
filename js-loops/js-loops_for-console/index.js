// Use a `for` loop to log the numbers from 0 to 100 (inclusive) in the console.

// Make sure your `for` loop includes:

// - An internal counter variable
// - A condition to be met by the counter variable
// - A rule for how the counter variable increments

// Switch to the `./index.js` file to start coding!
